# KNNRegressor-insurance.csv-
KNNRegressor- it is a distance based algorithm, lazy learner algorithm
considers distances--from point to nearest neighbors--takes the majority
to calculate distances bw 2 points:
1.euclidean(p=2)
2.manhattan(p=1)
3.minkowski(p=3)
4.hamming
>import all the libaries
>Read data into DataFrame
>define X,y
>split the data into X-test and y-test
>Create test of algorithm
>fit into algorithm
>Accuracy
We are using insurance.csv data sample
